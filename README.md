Hi, I'm Rob Costello, I'm an experienced technologist, builder and lifelong learner - I work with organisations of various types, from Enterprise to Public Sector, providing them with strategic and practical solutions for their business needs, using modern and leading edge technologies.

With over 25 years as a technologist I have learnt to engage with customers from executive and business leaders, through to technology development and operations teams. Having worked in delivery, architecture, consulting and pre-sales roles, I have developed a broad set of skills across various technologies and organisational types.

By nature I am curious and love to learn, and while I enjoy building.
